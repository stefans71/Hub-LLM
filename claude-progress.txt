**Notes**: Create Project page fully implemented. AI chat integration simulates responses (needs backend endpoint POST /api/ai/expand-brief for production). GitHub OAuth uses existing flow. VPS form ready for connection testing.

### Session 5 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: AI Brief Expansion (create-002, create-003)
**Completed**:
- Created backend endpoint `/api/ai/expand-brief` for analyzing project briefs
- Created backend endpoint `/api/ai/chat` for follow-up conversation about the project
- Integrated streaming SSE responses for real-time chat experience
- Updated CreateProject.jsx to call real AI endpoints instead of simulated responses
- AI generates tech_stack, standards, context, quirks from project brief
- AI chat panel supports follow-up questions with streaming responses
- Context updates can be extracted from AI responses

**Files created**:
- backend/routers/ai.py (AI brief expansion and chat endpoints)

**Files modified**:
- backend/main.py (registered AI router)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (real API integration)

**Notes**: AI integration requires OpenRouter API key in localStorage (set via Settings > API Keys). The expand-brief endpoint uses a system prompt to generate structured JSON with project configuration recommendations.

### Session 6 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: GitHub OAuth in Create Project (github-001)
**Completed**:
- Added popup mode to GitHub OAuth endpoint (`/api/auth/oauth/github?mode=popup`)
- Created new popup callback endpoint (`/api/auth/oauth/github/popup/callback`)
- Popup callback returns HTML that posts message to opener window with user info
- Updated frontend handleConnectGitHub to use popup mode
- Added origin verification for security in message handler
- Updated get_github_user to include `login` field for username display
- Added `repo` scope for future repository selection feature

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/auth.py (popup mode and popup callback endpoint)
- backend/services/auth.py (added login field to return)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (popup mode OAuth)

**Notes**: GitHub OAuth requires GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables to be configured. The popup flow posts a message with user info (login, avatar_url) back to the opener window for the connected state UI.

### Session 7 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: GitHub Repository Selection (github-002)
**Completed**:
- Modified `get_github_user` to return the GitHub access token along with user info
- Updated popup OAuth callback to include `github_token` in the message to opener window
- Added `fetchGitHubRepos` function in CreateProject.jsx to fetch user's repos via `/api/github/repos`
- Repository dropdown now populates with real GitHub repositories after OAuth connection
- Added loading state while fetching repositories
- Updated success message to show selected repository name
- Conditional messaging: blue info message when no repo selected, green success when repo selected

**Files modified**:
- backend/services/auth.py (return access_token in get_github_user)
- backend/routers/auth.py (include github_token in popup callback message)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (real repo fetching and dynamic dropdown)

**Notes**: The GitHub repos endpoint `/api/github/repos` already existed in the codebase. The key change was passing the GitHub access token from the OAuth flow to the frontend so it can make authenticated API calls to fetch repositories.

### Session 8 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Dashboard view (dash-001)
**Completed**:
- Created Dashboard.jsx page component with full mockup styling
- Stats grid with 3 stat cards (Active Sessions, Total Projects, Connected LLMs)
- Projects grid with project cards showing name, description, status, source type
- View toggle between grid and list modes
- Empty state with "Create Project" button when no projects exist
- Page header with "Project Dashboard" title and action buttons
- Integrated Dashboard as default view after login
- Added navigation from Dashboard to Workspace when clicking project card
- Added Dashboard button in header when in Workspace view

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx (complete dashboard page)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (Dashboard import, default view, routing)

**Notes**: Dashboard fetches projects from `/api/projects/` endpoint. Stats are calculated from project data (GitHub vs Local counts). LLM count is set to 5 (OpenRouter + Anthropic). Future enhancement: add backend `/api/stats/dashboard` endpoint for real-time stats.

### Session 9 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Dashboard usage statistics (dash-002)
**Completed**:
- Created new `/api/stats/dashboard` backend endpoint for aggregated stats
- Endpoint returns: projects_count, tokens_used, active_agents, github_projects, local_projects
- Token usage fetched from OpenRouter API when API key provided via header
- Updated Dashboard.jsx stat cards to show:
  - Total Projects (count with GitHub/Local breakdown)
  - Tokens Used (from OpenRouter API with K/M formatting)
  - Active Agents (default 4 agents enabled)
- Added Coins and Bot icons from lucide-react for new stats
- Refresh All button now reloads both projects and stats

**Files created**:
- backend/routers/stats.py (dashboard stats endpoint)

**Files modified**:
- backend/main.py (registered stats router)
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx (new stat cards, stats fetching)

**Notes**: Token usage requires OpenRouter API key in localStorage (`openrouter_api_key`). The endpoint converts OpenRouter's USD usage to approximate token counts. Active agents count is currently a default (4) until the agents feature is fully implemented.

### Session 10 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Settings page with Profile section (settings-001)
**Completed**:
- Created full Settings page (`Settings.jsx`) with sidebar navigation
- Implemented Profile settings section with:
  - Avatar display (from OAuth or initials)
  - Display Name field
  - AI Assistant Alias field (stored in localStorage)
  - Email field
  - Timezone selector (12 common timezones)
  - Save Profile button with loading state and success/error messages
- Implemented API Keys settings section with:
  - OpenRouter API key input with show/hide toggle
  - Save and Remove buttons
  - Connection status display
- Implemented Appearance settings section with:
  - Theme selector (Dark/Light/System)
  - Compact Mode toggle
  - Show Line Numbers toggle
- Added backend PUT /api/auth/me endpoint for updating user profile
- Added UserUpdate schema in auth service
- Added update_user function in auth service
- Integrated Settings page into App.jsx as full-screen view
- Settings page has its own sidebar navigation (Profile, API Keys, Appearance)
- Back to Dashboard navigation from Settings

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (full settings page with 3 sections)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (Settings import, routing, full-screen layout)
- backend/routers/auth.py (PUT /me endpoint)
- backend/services/auth.py (UserUpdate schema, update_user function)

**Notes**: Settings page follows mockup design with CSS variables. Profile changes are saved to backend, while preferences (AI alias, timezone, theme, etc.) are saved to localStorage. The API Keys section handles OpenRouter key which is used for AI chat functionality.

### Session 11 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Upload .md file as project brief (create-004)
**Completed**:
- Enhanced file upload feature in CreateProject.jsx with visual feedback
- Added `uploadedFileName` state to track uploaded file
- Shows checkmark and filename after successful upload
- "Upload .md file" label changes to "Change file" after upload
- File input accepts .md and .txt files
- FileReader loads content directly into project brief textarea

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (upload feedback UI, filename state)

**Notes**: The file upload feature was already partially implemented but lacked visual feedback. Added filename display with checkmark icon so users can see confirmation that their file was loaded successfully.

### Session 12 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: API Keys management with verification (settings-002)
**Completed**:
- Added backend `/api/stats/verify-api-key` endpoint to verify OpenRouter API keys
- Endpoint calls OpenRouter's `/auth/key` to check validity and retrieve account info
- Returns: validity status, label, usage (USD), limit (USD), tier status, rate limits
- Added "Verify" button to API Keys settings section
- Shows loading state while verifying
- Displays account info panel when key is verified:
  - Key label from OpenRouter
  - Usage/limit in USD
  - Tier status (Free/Paid)
- Resets account info when key is changed
- Added spin keyframe animation to index.css for loading icon

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/stats.py (verify-api-key endpoint, APIKeyVerifyResponse schema)
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (handleVerify, accountInfo state, Verify button, account info display)
- frontend/src/index.css (spin animation keyframes)

**Files created**: None

**Notes**: The API key verification feature completes the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) functionality. Users can now verify their OpenRouter API key works before using it, and see account details like usage and tier status.
