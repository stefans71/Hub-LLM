'Skip for now' (line 1294) → calls `handleSkip` (line 1216) → only calls `onComplete()` locally → `setup_completed` stays `false` in Postgres → wizard reappears on every visit\n2. 'Don't show this again' (line 1308) → calls `handleComplete` (line 1191) → calls `POST /api/auth/me/setup-complete` → persists to DB\n\nThe 'Don't show this again' button is nearly invisible: 11px font, 60% opacity (lines 1303-1305). Most users click 'Skip for now' and get trapped.\n\nFix: Remove the two-button distinction. 'Skip for now' should ALSO call the backend to persist `setup_completed = true`. There's no good reason to trap users — they can always revisit settings later.

Log into Coolify dashboard at hq.vibeship.cloud\n2. Find the Hub-LLM project/service\n3. Check 'Proxy' or 'Advanced' settings — look for 'Custom Domains' config\n4.

Claude Code natively scopes conversations to the working directory. New: (1) Per-project session tracking via localStorage key `claude_session_{slug}` — when previous session exists, uses `claude -c` (auto-continue most recent) instead of `claude --resume` (picker) for smoother UX. (2) Added `onProcessingChange` callback chain: ClaudeCodeTerminalChat → Chat → Workspace → WorkspaceFileExplorer. Active project dot now pulses with 1.5s animation and enhanced glow when Claude is processing. Auth required for full test — noted: auth verified separately."
