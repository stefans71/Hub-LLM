      "description": "BLOCKER. After creating a new account, the Setup wizard (/setup) is skipped — user goes straight to /dashboard. Root cause: race condition in App.jsx. setupComplete state initialized to true (line 26), and the useEffect that reads user.setup_completed (lines 34-37) runs AFTER the first render. So the redirect check at lines 116-122 sees setupComplete=true on the initial render and either doesn't redirect to /setup or actively redirects away from it. The backend correctly returns setup_completed:false for new users (models/__init__.py:70, services/auth.py:479).",
