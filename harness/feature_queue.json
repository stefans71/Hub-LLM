The users table was created before setup_completed was added, so the column doesn't exist in production. The original BUG-28 fix (null-init timing in frontend) was correct for a separate issue but didn't address this. Additionally, init_db() at line 242 uses 'SELECT name FROM sqlite_master' which is SQLite-specific and will silently fail on Postgres.
