# Dogfooding Log

Track findings from using HubLLM to build real projects. Each entry captures what worked, what broke, and what needs improvement in the harness/workspace experience.

## Active Dogfood Projects

| Project | Slug | Started | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| TheFishStocker.com | TBD (pending creation) | 2026-02-08 | Pending — waiting for FEAT-31 deploy |

## How to Use This Log

When the user reports a dogfooding finding:
1. Log it here with date and context
2. If it's a Hub-LLM bug → also write BUG-XX to `feature_queue.json`
3. If it's a template issue → also update `harness-template-design.md`
4. If it's a product insight → also update `LLM-HUB-Vision-V2.md`
