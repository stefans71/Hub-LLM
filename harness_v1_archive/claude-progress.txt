**Notes**: Create Project page fully implemented. AI chat integration simulates responses (needs backend endpoint POST /api/ai/expand-brief for production). GitHub OAuth uses existing flow. VPS form ready for connection testing.

### Session 5 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: AI Brief Expansion (create-002, create-003)
**Completed**:
- Created backend endpoint `/api/ai/expand-brief` for analyzing project briefs
- Created backend endpoint `/api/ai/chat` for follow-up conversation about the project
- Integrated streaming SSE responses for real-time chat experience
- Updated CreateProject.jsx to call real AI endpoints instead of simulated responses
- AI generates tech_stack, standards, context, quirks from project brief
- AI chat panel supports follow-up questions with streaming responses

**Files created**:
- backend/routers/ai.py (AI brief expansion and chat endpoints)

**Files modified**:
- backend/main.py (registered AI router)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (real API integration)

**Notes**: AI integration requires OpenRouter API key in localStorage (set via Settings > API Keys). The expand-brief endpoint uses a system prompt to generate structured JSON with project configuration recommendations.

### Session 6 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: GitHub OAuth in Create Project (github-001)
**Completed**:
- Added popup mode to GitHub OAuth endpoint (`/api/auth/oauth/github?mode=popup`)
- Created new popup callback endpoint (`/api/auth/oauth/github/popup/callback`)
- Popup callback returns HTML that posts message to opener window with user info
- Updated frontend handleConnectGitHub to use popup mode
- Added origin verification for security in message handler
- Updated get_github_user to include `login` field for username display
- Added `repo` scope for future repository selection feature

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/auth.py (popup mode and popup callback endpoint)
- backend/services/auth.py (added login field to return)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (popup mode OAuth)

**Notes**: GitHub OAuth requires GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables to be configured. The popup flow posts a message with user info (login, avatar_url) back to the opener window for the connected state UI.

### Session 7 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: GitHub Repository Selection (github-002)
**Completed**:
- Modified `get_github_user` to return the GitHub access token along with user info
- Updated popup OAuth callback to include `github_token` in the message to opener window
- Added `fetchGitHubRepos` function in CreateProject.jsx to fetch user's repos via `/api/github/repos`
- Repository dropdown now populates with real GitHub repositories after OAuth connection
- Added loading state while fetching repositories
- Updated success message to show selected repository name
- Conditional messaging: blue info message when no repo selected, green success when repo selected

**Files modified**:
- backend/services/auth.py (return access_token in get_github_user)
- backend/routers/auth.py (include github_token in popup callback message)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (real repo fetching and dynamic dropdown)

**Notes**: The GitHub repos endpoint `/api/github/repos` already existed in the codebase. The key change was passing the GitHub access token from the OAuth flow to the frontend so it can make authenticated API calls to fetch repositories.

### Session 8 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Dashboard view (dash-001)
**Completed**:
- Created Dashboard.jsx page component with full mockup styling
- Stats grid with 3 stat cards (Active Sessions, Total Projects, Connected LLMs)
- Projects grid with project cards showing name, description, status, source type
- View toggle between grid and list modes
- Empty state with "Create Project" button when no projects exist
- Page header with "Project Dashboard" title and action buttons
- Integrated Dashboard as default view after login
- Added navigation from Dashboard to Workspace when clicking project card
- Added Dashboard button in header when in Workspace view

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx (complete dashboard page)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (Dashboard import, default view, routing)

**Notes**: Dashboard fetches projects from `/api/projects/` endpoint. Stats are calculated from project data (GitHub vs Local counts). LLM count is set to 5 (OpenRouter + Anthropic). Future enhancement: add backend `/api/stats/dashboard` endpoint for real-time stats.

### Session 9 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Dashboard usage statistics (dash-002)
**Completed**:
- Created new `/api/stats/dashboard` backend endpoint for aggregated stats
- Endpoint returns: projects_count, tokens_used, active_agents, github_projects, local_projects
- Token usage fetched from OpenRouter API when API key provided via header
- Updated Dashboard.jsx stat cards to show:
  - Total Projects (count with GitHub/Local breakdown)
  - Tokens Used (from OpenRouter API with K/M formatting)
  - Active Agents (default 4 agents enabled)
- Added Coins and Bot icons from lucide-react for new stats
- Refresh All button now reloads both projects and stats

**Files created**:
- backend/routers/stats.py (dashboard stats endpoint)

**Files modified**:
- backend/main.py (registered stats router)
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx (new stat cards, stats fetching)

**Notes**: Token usage requires OpenRouter API key in localStorage (`openrouter_api_key`). The endpoint converts OpenRouter's USD usage to approximate token counts. Active agents count is currently a default (4) until the agents feature is fully implemented.

### Session 10 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Settings page with Profile section (settings-001)
**Completed**:
- Created full Settings page (`Settings.jsx`) with sidebar navigation

- Implemented Appearance settings section with:
  - Theme selector (Dark/Light/System)
  - Compact Mode toggle
  - Show Line Numbers toggle
- Added backend PUT /api/auth/me endpoint for updating user profile
- Added UserUpdate schema in auth service
- Added update_user function in auth service
- Integrated Settings page into App.jsx as full-screen view
- Settings page has its own sidebar navigation (Profile, API Keys, Appearance)
- Back to Dashboard navigation from Settings

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (full settings page with 3 sections)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (Settings import, routing, full-screen layout)
- backend/routers/auth.py (PUT /me endpoint)
- backend/services/auth.py (UserUpdate schema, update_user function)

**Notes**: Settings page follows mockup design with CSS variables. Profile changes are saved to backend, while preferences (AI alias, timezone, theme, etc.) are saved to localStorage. The API Keys section handles OpenRouter key which is used for AI chat functionality.

### Session 11 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Upload .md file as project brief (create-004)
**Completed**:
- Enhanced file upload feature in CreateProject.jsx with visual feedback
- Added `uploadedFileName` state to track uploaded file
- Shows checkmark and filename after successful upload
- "Upload .md file" label changes to "Change file" after upload
- File input accepts .md and .txt files
- FileReader loads content directly into project brief textarea

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (upload feedback UI, filename state)

**Notes**: The file upload feature was already partially implemented but lacked visual feedback. Added filename display with checkmark icon so users can see confirmation that their file was loaded successfully.

### Session 12 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: API Keys management with verification (settings-002)
**Completed**:
- Added backend `/api/stats/verify-api-key` endpoint to verify OpenRouter API keys
- Endpoint calls OpenRouter's `/auth/key` to check validity and retrieve account info
- Returns: validity status, label, usage (USD), limit (USD), tier status, rate limits
- Added "Verify" button to API Keys settings section
- Shows loading state while verifying
- Displays account info panel when key is verified:
  - Key label from OpenRouter
  - Usage/limit in USD
  - Tier status (Free/Paid)
- Resets account info when key is changed
- Added spin keyframe animation to index.css for loading icon

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/stats.py (verify-api-key endpoint, APIKeyVerifyResponse schema)
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (handleVerify, accountInfo state, Verify button, account info display)
- frontend/src/index.css (spin animation keyframes)

**Files created**: None

**Notes**: The API key verification feature completes the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) functionality. Users can now verify their OpenRouter API key works before using it, and see account details like usage and tier status.

### Session 13 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Create new repository from dropdown (github-003)
**Completed**:
- Added `create_repo` method to GitHubService in backend
- Added POST `/api/github/repos` endpoint to create new repositories
- Updated CreateProject.jsx with new repo creation form:
  - Added state for `showCreateRepoForm`, `newRepoName`, `creatingRepo`, `createRepoError`
  - Added `handleCreateRepo` function to call API and create repository
  - Added `handleRepoChange` to show/hide the create form when dropdown selection changes
  - Inline form appears when "Create new repository" is selected
  - Shows repository name input with validation
  - Shows preview of full repo name (user/repo-name)
  - Create button with loading state
  - Error display for failed creation
  - Auto-selects the new repo after successful creation

**Files modified**:
- backend/services/github.py (added create_repo method)
- backend/routers/github.py (added POST /repos endpoint, httpx import)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (create repo form and handlers)

**Notes**: The GitHub API requires a valid token with `repo` scope to create repositories. The endpoint handles 422 errors for duplicate/invalid repo names gracefully. The form validates repo names to only allow alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, and periods.

### Session 14 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Dashboard sidebar with workspace tree (dash-003)
**Completed**:
- Created new `DashboardSidebar.jsx` component matching mockup design
- Sidebar features:
  - Main navigation section with Dashboard and Settings links
  - Workspaces section with collapsible workspace folders
  - Projects nested under workspaces (grouped by project.workspace field)
  - Archives section placeholder
  - Collapse/expand sidebar functionality
  - Footer with New Project button and user profile
- Updated App.jsx to use DashboardSidebar when currentView is 'dashboard'
- Sidebar integrates with navigation (clicking project opens workspace view)
- User profile in footer links to Settings page
- Mockup-consistent styling using CSS variables

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/components/DashboardSidebar.jsx (full sidebar component)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (imported DashboardSidebar, separate layout for dashboard view)

**Notes**: Projects are grouped by their `workspace` field. If a project doesn't have a workspace, it goes into "Default". The sidebar can be collapsed to a thin strip for more screen space. Clicking a project navigates to the workspace view with that project active.

### Session 15 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Voice input in AI chat panel (create-005)
**Completed**:
- Added voice input functionality to the AI chat panel in Create Project page
- Integrated existing `useVoice` hook from VoiceInput component
- Microphone button now toggles voice recording on/off
- Voice transcription automatically appends to chat input field
- Visual feedback: button turns red and pulses when recording
- Graceful degradation: shows MicOff icon and disabled state if browser doesn't support Web Speech API
- Added appropriate hover titles for different states

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (imported useVoice hook, added voice state, connected mic button)

**Notes**: Uses the Web Speech API which is free and works in Chrome, Edge, and Safari. The existing VoiceInput.jsx component provided the `useVoice` hook which made integration straightforward. Transcript is appended to chat input on each speech recognition result.

### Session 16 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: VPS connection form expansion (vps-001)
**Completed**:
- Enhanced VPS card with visual feedback matching mockup design
- Border color changes to primary blue when expanded
- Box shadow appears when expanded for depth
- Hover effect on header changes border color
- Added info emoji to "Help finding key" link
- Smooth transitions for all visual state changes

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (VPS card styling with hover/expand states)

**Notes**: The VPS expansion functionality already existed but lacked the visual polish from the mockup. Added transition effects and dynamic border colors to match the design spec. The form includes Server Select, IP Address, Port, and SSH Private Key fields with a Test Connection button (functionality in vps-002).

### Session 17 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: VPS connection test functionality (vps-002)
**Completed**:
- Added POST `/api/ssh/test` endpoint for testing VPS connections without storing credentials
- Endpoint attempts SSH connection with provided credentials and returns success/failure
- On success, runs basic commands (uname, hostname, whoami) to gather server info
- Comprehensive error handling for common SSH errors:
  - Connection timeout (10 second limit)
  - Authentication failed (wrong password/key)
  - Connection refused (SSH not running)
  - DNS resolution failures (bad hostname)
  - Network unreachable
- Updated CreateProject.jsx with VPS test functionality:
  - Added `testingVps` and `vpsTestResult` state variables
  - Added `handleTestVps` async function to call the API
  - Test Connection button shows loading spinner during test
  - Success shows green banner with server hostname, user, and OS info
  - Failure shows red banner with helpful error message

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/ssh.py (added TestConnectionRequest, TestConnectionResponse models, POST /test endpoint)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (added VPS test state, handler, and result display)

**Notes**: The test endpoint uses asyncssh which is already installed for the existing SSH terminal features. The endpoint tests the connection and immediately closes it - credentials are not stored. Error messages are user-friendly and suggest specific fixes for common problems.

### Session 18 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Verify agent selection functionality (agents-001)
**Completed**:
- Verified Step 4 Project Agents agent selection functionality is working
- Agent list displays 3 global agents (code-reviewer, security-audit, test-writer)
- Individual agent checkboxes toggle selection state correctly
- Selection count updates dynamically (shows "X agents selected")
- Master checkbox toggles all agents on/off (handleToggleAllAgents)
- AgentItem component provides visual feedback (opacity changes based on selection)

**Files verified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (lines 412-416, 782-805, 1749-1875)

**Notes**: The agent selection feature was already implemented in Session 4 as part of the Create Project page. This session verified the functionality works as expected and marked agents-001 as passing. The implementation includes individual toggles, "select all" master checkbox, and dynamic selection count display.

### Session 19 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Master checkbox for agents (agents-002)
**Completed**:
- Enhanced master "Use Global Agents" checkbox with indeterminate state support
- Added refs for both agents and MCP checkboxes
- Added useEffect hooks to set indeterminate state when some but not all items selected
- Updated checkbox labels to match spec ("Use Global Agents" and "Use Global MCP Servers")
- Verified handleToggleAllAgents correctly toggles all agents on/off

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (refs, useEffect for indeterminate state, label updates)

**Notes**: The select-all functionality was already implemented in Session 4 via handleToggleAllAgents. This session enhanced it with proper indeterminate checkbox state (shows dash when some but not all selected) which is standard UX for select-all controls.

### Session 20 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: MCP server selection (mcp-001)
**Completed**:
- Verified MCP server selection functionality in Step 5 of Create Project
- Fixed confusing status text: "Not selected" → "○ Not configured" for clarity
- Updated selection count to show connected servers: "X of Y connected servers selected"
- MCP functionality includes:
  - Global MCP server list (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive)
  - Individual server checkboxes for selection
  - Master checkbox to select/deselect all connected servers
  - Indeterminate state when some servers selected
  - Dynamic selection count display
  - Visual feedback (opacity) for selected vs unselected

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (status text fix, count text improvement)
- feature_list.json (marked mcp-001 as passing)

**Notes**: The MCP selection was already implemented in Session 4 but lacked proper UX text. Fixed the confusing "Not selected" text which could be misread as checkbox state instead of connection status.

- Updated Project model with all new fields and status tracking
- Enhanced frontend handleCreateProject with proper data formatting
- Added loading state (creatingProject) with spinner on Create button
- Added error handling with visible error banner
- Integrated with App.jsx handleProjectCreated callback for:
  - Adding project to state
  - Setting as active project
  - Navigating to workspace view
- Projects now properly appear in sidebar after creation

**Files modified**:
- backend/routers/projects.py (extended schemas, updated create_project endpoint)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (loading state, error handling, data formatting)

**Notes**: Full project creation flow now works end-to-end. User fills out all 5 steps, clicks Create Project, backend saves with all configuration (workspace, connection, context, agents, MCP servers), and redirects to workspace view. Project immediately appears in sidebar.

### Session 22 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Add custom MCP server (mcp-002)
**Completed**:
- Added Global MCP Servers section to Settings page
- Created MCPModal component for adding/editing MCP servers
- Supports 3 server types: Database, API/Service, and Custom

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (added MCPModal, GlobalMCPSettings, navigation)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (load MCP servers from localStorage, handle emoji icons)

**Notes**: MCP servers are stored in localStorage under key 'mcp_servers'. The CreateProject page loads these servers and merges them with default servers (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive). Custom servers show their type (Database/API/Custom) and connection status.

### Session 23 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Logout flow (auth-005)
**Completed**:
- Added logout dropdown menu to DashboardSidebar user profile area
- Menu shows "Profile & Settings" and "Sign Out" options
- Dropdown appears above user profile with proper z-index
- Added Sign Out section to Settings > Profile page

- frontend/src/components/DashboardSidebar.jsx (added user menu dropdown with logout)
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (added Sign Out section to profile, LogOut icon import)
- frontend/src/App.jsx (passed onLogout to DashboardSidebar and Settings, enhanced handleLogout)

**Notes**: Logout is now accessible from three places: header user menu (workspace/create-project views), dashboard sidebar user profile dropdown, and Settings > Profile page. All locations call the same logout flow which clears tokens and redirects to login.

### Session 24 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Create new agent in settings (agents-003)
**Completed**:
- Added Global Agents section to Settings page
- Created AgentModal component for creating/editing agents with:
  - Agent name input (with @ prefix for invocation)

- Agents stored in localStorage under key 'global_agents'
- Default agents (code-reviewer, security-audit, test-writer) auto-created on first load

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx (AgentModal, GlobalAgentsSettings, navigation)
- frontend/src/pages/CreateProject.jsx (load agents from localStorage, AgentItem emoji support)

**Files created**: None

**Notes**: Custom agents created in Settings > Global Agents now appear in Step 4 of Create Project. Agents can be enabled/disabled - disabled agents won't appear in the Create Project agent selection.

### Session 25 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: VPS connections management in Settings (settings-003)
**Completed**:
- Added VPS Connections section to Settings page under Integrations

- tests/e2e/test-auth-login.sh
- tests/e2e/test-auth-signup.sh
- tests/e2e/test-dashboard-view.sh
- tests/e2e/test-create-project-view.sh
- tests/README.md

**Files modified**:
- package.json (test scripts, agent-browser dependency)
- feature_list.json (added test-001 feature)
- claude-progress.txt (this file)

**Notes**: The test harness uses agent-browser CLI which provides accessibility-first element selection via @e1, @e2 refs from snapshots. Tests are bash scripts that can be run individually or all together with `npm test`. Screenshots are saved to tests/e2e/screenshots/ on failure.

### Session 28 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Fix E2E tests and create mockup analysis (test-002, ui-fix-*)
**Completed**:
- Fixed all 5 E2E tests (were failing due to ref format changes):
  - Changed ref extraction from `@eN` to `[ref=eN]` format
  - Added proper login page detection for auth-required pages
  - Fixed browser initialization timing (added delay after close)
  - Added test-settings-view.sh for Settings page
  - All 5 tests now pass reliably
- Created comprehensive mockup analysis:
  - Copied mockup to tests/Troubleshooting/
  - Took screenshots of all 4 mockup views
  - Took screenshots of current implementation for comparison
  - Created MOCKUP_ANALYSIS.md with detailed component comparison
- Analyzed actual component code vs mockup:
  - Dashboard.jsx: Different stat cards
  - Settings.jsx: Missing 4 sections (Anthropic, Skills, Voice, Model)
  - Workspace.jsx: Missing file sidebar, bottom bar, project header
  - CreateProject.jsx: Shows project sidebar (should be hidden)
- Added 5 UI fix phases to feature_list.json

**Files created**:
- tests/e2e/test-settings-view.sh
- tests/Troubleshooting/MOCKUP_ANALYSIS.md
- tests/Troubleshooting/*.png (7 screenshots)
- tests/Troubleshooting/hubllm-mockup-v2.html (copy)

**Files modified**:
- tests/e2e/run-tests.sh (browser close before tests)
- tests/e2e/test-auth-login.sh (ref format fix)
- tests/e2e/test-auth-signup.sh (ref format fix)
- tests/e2e/test-create-project-view.sh (login detection, click nav)
- tests/e2e/test-dashboard-view.sh (login detection)
- feature_list.json (added ui-fix-001 through ui-fix-005)

**Notes**: Detailed gap analysis in tests/Troubleshooting/MOCKUP_ANALYSIS.md identifies exactly what needs to change. UI fix phases are prioritized: Phase 1 (header nav) and Phase 2 (workspace) are HIGH priority.

### Session 29 - 2026-01-23
**Focus**: Header navigation with tabs (ui-fix-001)
**Completed**:
- Created HeaderNavigation.jsx component with four navigation tabs
- Tabs: Dashboard, Workspace, Settings, Create Project (matching mockup design)
- Added react-router-dom for URL-based routing
- Updated App.jsx to use BrowserRouter with Routes
- Header shows HubLLM.dev logo, navigation tabs, and user menu
- All views accessible via header tabs with proper URL paths
- Dashboard sidebar only shows on /dashboard route
- User menu dropdown with Profile & Settings and Sign Out options
- Navigation tabs have active state styling (blue background when selected)
- Hover effects on tabs match mockup design

**Files created**:
- frontend/src/components/HeaderNavigation.jsx (header with nav tabs)

**Files modified**:
- frontend/src/App.jsx (react-router-dom integration, BrowserRouter, Routes)
- frontend/package.json (added react-router-dom dependency)
- feature_list.json (marked ui-fix-001 as passing)

**Notes**: Navigation now uses URL-based routing (/dashboard, /workspace, /settings, /create-project) instead of state-based currentView. The header is consistent across all views, matching the mockup design.
